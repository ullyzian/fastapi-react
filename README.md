# FastAPI + React boilerplate

Original idea of repository: https://github.com/Buuntu/fastapi-react
Repository refactored and change a little bit for personal usages

## Setup

For domain name for development use "localhost" or "example"(preferably)

If you on unix system, edit `/etc/hosts` file by adding following:
```text
127.0.0.1    example.com
127.0.0.1    api.example.com
127.0.0.1    flower.example.com
```
With localhost `flower.localhost` url will does not work

## TODO:
- Try to use Poetry as dependencies handler
- Reformat frontend
- Add redux
- Add axios
- Add SCSS
